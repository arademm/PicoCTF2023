The Challenge: I was to make a bunch of letters and numbers make sense.
*** 
My Approach:
  - I studied the challenge. A hint to what type of string was presented was given.
  - I used a Linux machine's command line interface to try decrypting the string using an in-built decryption tool for base64 decryption
  - The result didn't make sense so I tried the decryption command again and again using the result.
  - Finally it made sense.

***
Tools Used:
  - echo command
  - Basez
